# How it Works
Fundamentally, the Module works by allow you, the developer, to specify different "Lighting Periods" within the ModuleScript.  Lighting Periods are simply ranges of time that have specific lighting settings in them.  

Here's an example of what this looks like visually (with some example Lighting Periods)

A very basic example of where this would be useful would be making the Ambient and Outdoor Ambient settings darker at night.  However, you can create as many Lighting Periods as you like!  This allows you to create lighting periods to replicate things like dawn, twilight, night-time (or even different stages of night as well)!
