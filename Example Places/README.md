Here are a collection of example places that display how to use the module.

Credits are reiterated inside the places, but the place used to display this is an uncopylocked version of Soro's restaurant (from 2017 I believe, so I believe no one is using this anymore)
The rain module is buildthomas' which can be found on DevForum
The day/night script is one I randomly found in the Toolbox to demonstrate that any day/night script can be used
